# mhm - Mental Health modelling
`mhm` lets you run an agent-based simulation model to study mental health outcomes during covid-19 lockdowns. 

# Why?
This project aims at understanding the full spectrum of impacts the lockdown policies had during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically on non-COVID-19-related health outcomes, such as mental health. Although lockdowns reduced disease transmission and mortality, they also potentially exacerbated mental health issues. By using `mhm` you can simulate real-world scenarios, and estimate/compare the effects of lockdown policies on the mental health of an a-priori defined population across time.

# Installation
